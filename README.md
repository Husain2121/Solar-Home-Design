#  Solar-Powered Smart Home Simulation in MATLAB Simulink

This repository contains my personalized MATLAB Simulink model of a solar-powered residential system, developed after following the tutorial “Solar-Powered Home in Simulink” on YouTube.

##  What I Built  
- A working Simulink model replicating a solar-powered home system with generation, load, and energy storage components.
- Custom enhancements to the tutorial model, including improved load profiles and better component sizing.
