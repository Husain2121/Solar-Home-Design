#  Solar-Powered Smart Home Simulation in MATLAB Simulink

This repository contains my personalized MATLAB Simulink model of a solar-powered residential system, developed after following the tutorial “Solar-Powered Home in Simulink” on YouTube.

##  What I Built  
- A working Simulink model replicating a solar-powered home system with generation, load, and energy storage components.
- Custom enhancements to the tutorial model, including improved load profiles and better component sizing.
## Acknowledgement
Based on the tutorial video by [Solar-Powered Home in Simulink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQcMuLC8_DE). Big thanks for the clear walkthrough—I used it as a foundation, then added custom improvements.
